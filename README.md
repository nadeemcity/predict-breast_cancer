This project is a Breast Cancer Prediction System built using Machine Learning
It predicts whether a breast tumor is Benign or Malignant based on input medical features
The model helps in early detection and decision support by analyzing diagnostic data

The main goals of this project are:

To classify breast cancer tumors as Benign (0) or Malignant (1)

To apply machine learning techniques for medical diagnosis

To deploy the trained model using Streamlit for user-friendly interaction
